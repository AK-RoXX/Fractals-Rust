# 🌀 Rust Fractal Generator

A high-performance, real-time fractal generator built with Rust. This project uses the **Julia Set** formula and utilizes multi-threading to render smooth, infinite patterns.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* **Rust & Cargo:** [Install Rust](https://rustup.rs/)
* **C++ Build Tools:** (Required for Windows users to link the graphics library)

### Running the App
For the best experience, always run in **release mode** to enable compiler optimizations:
```bash
cargo run --release
